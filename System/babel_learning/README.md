# Learning-Management-System

How to use:
------
### Framework and libraries we are using:

- React JS
- Node JS
- Next JS
- Semantic UI
- Ant Design

## Important: To use the frameworks above, please make sure to install Node.js (npm) and use npm to install next.js dependencies if necessary

#### To work on the website code with hot-reload on a local server, please follow the instructions below:

1. Go to the root folder cd /babel_learning

2. Inside that directory, you can run several commands:

    -npm run dev: Starts the development server
    -npm run build: Builds the website for production.
    -npm start: Runs the built website in production mode.

    run build to update folder when changes are made to packages and dependencies
    run dev during development for hot reload
    run start to launch website in production mode (i.e. no hot-reload)

3. If the website does not open on its own, open your browser and go to localhost:3000, you should see a demo page with links to the documentations of the libraries

Note: During development, we will mainly be working in the /pages and /components folders for the frontend, please place all materials (jpg, png, etc) into the /static/materials/ folder

To access stylesheets from the UI libraries, import the css files accordingly for the page you are using it for, check index.js for examples.
